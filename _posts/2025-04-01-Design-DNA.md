## Still designing Manual ?


1. **Empathy First**: Deep understanding of user context, needs, frustrations
2. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Obvious wins over clever
3. **Accessible by Default**: Not an afterthought
4. **Feedback Loops**: Users always know what's happening
5. **Graceful Failure**: When things go wrong, recovery is clear
6. **Continuous Learning**: Adapts to user behavior over time


**The Golden Rule**: If you need a manual to explain basic functionality, the design has failed.
