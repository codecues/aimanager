AI and Non-AI Tools for Agile Leads, Scrum Masters & Managers
Jira is the go-to tool for most Agile teams, especially for those following Scrum. However, Agile leaders—Scrum Masters, Team Leads, and Project Managers—can enhance their workflow with additional AI and non-AI tools. Let’s explore some options that go beyond Jira’s core features.

Atlassian Intelligence: AI-Powered Jira Assistance
Jira Cloud’s built-in Atlassian Intelligence leverages OpenAI technology to automate tasks, streamline workflows, and enhance productivity. Here’s how it helps:

✅ Smart Issue Recommendations – Suggests related Jira tickets based on content.
✅ AI-Powered Search – Understands natural language queries like, “Show all high-priority bugs assigned to me.”

✅ AI-Generated Summaries – Provides concise updates on issues, sprints, and backlog items.
✅ Automated Ticket Creation – Converts meeting notes or Slack discussions into Jira tasks.
✅ Smart Notifications – Filters important updates, reducing information overload.

By integrating AI, teams can save time on manual issue tracking and focus on value-driven work.

Automating Prioritization in Jira (No Additional Apps Required!)
Jira’s built-in automation allows teams to prioritize backlog items without third-party plugins.

RICE Scoring in Jira (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)

📌 Formula:
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

🔧 How to Automate in Jira:
1️⃣ Add custom fields: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort.
2️⃣ Create an automation rule using Jira’s smart values:


{{issue.Reach}} * {{issue.Impact}} * {{issue.Confidence}} / {{issue.Effort}}

3️⃣ Automatically update the Priority field based on the score range.

By leveraging Jira’s native automation, 
teams can prioritize effectively without the need for additional apps.
