Heyy Tharif.M  here, a tech enthusiast with over a decade of experience across diverse domains—EdTech, Retail POS, HRMS, XR, Asset Management, Industrial Digital Twin, US Healthcare Ops and the Creative Space. Fortunate enough to have worked with Top Notch Leaders in the Industry including from IIT Madras, which has shaped my Methodology and Successful Releases.

This site ll be a self-reference repo & artifact to share wth like-minded individuals.

> After hosting and managing dozens of apps, I’m excited to introduce AI-Manager.in—a space where I share insights, tech tips, and productivity hacks inspired by my journey.
